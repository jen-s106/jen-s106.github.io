        <p>With the continuation of the carousel, I came across a 
            problem that my images were all different sizes.
            <br>
            <br>
            To fix this, I implemented a line of style code in 
            the js file as shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="media/carosuel_style.jpg" alt="style">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Upon fixing this problem, I realized that I was
            having difficulty completing this project, I 
            was not being organized. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I decided to take a step back. To do this I would
            create a list of things I would want to add and 
            create a prototype, which I should of done before, 
            to limit the stress I have for this project.
