            <h1>Week 3 Documentation</h1>
            <p>When the app prototype was created, I was only
                thinking about wanting my users to learn about trees.
                I wanted my users to know about different types of 
                trees using a camera feature that scans them.              
                However, I would like to create a website
                that reserches about the causes that deforesation
                has on that animals and resources that help wildlife.
            </p>
