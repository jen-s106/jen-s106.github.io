    <h1>Week 6 Documentation</h1>
    <p>With the addition of the navigation bar that I found
        on  <a href ="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navbar/">React-Bootstrap</a>
        I was having difficulty trying to make it work. It was visible but it did not connect
        to the 4 pages that I would like to be present.
        <br>
        <br>
        To fix this error I looked up a video on YouTube which
        helped creating the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLfhMt5OUPI">Navigation Bar</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the NavBar was working, I noticed that not all my 
        pages where the color that I wanted as seen in Protoype.
        I am wanting to make a Div that connects all the code 
        but when I compiled, the color that I wanted the site to
        have would not appear.
        <br>
        To solve this problem. I went on 
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42464888/how-do-i-change-the-background-color-of-the-body">stackoverflow</a>
        and found that I have to improt it in the file giving
        it a name. Then for it to appear, I have to add it
        in a line of code within a div along with curly brackets.
