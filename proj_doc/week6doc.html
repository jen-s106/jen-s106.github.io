    <h1>Week 6 Documentation</h1>
    <p>With the addition of the navigation bar that I found
        on  <a href ="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navbar/">React-Bootstrap</a>
        I was having difficulty trying to make it work. It was visible but it did not connect
        to the 4 pages that I would like to be present.
        <br>
        <br>
        To fix this error I looked up a video on YouTube which
        helped creating the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLfhMt5OUPI">Navigation Bar</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the NavBar was working, I noticed that not all my 
        pages where the color that I wanted as seen in the protoype.
        I started by making a Div that connects all the code 
        but when I compiled, the background color would not appear.
        <br>
        To solve this problem. I went on 
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42464888/how-do-i-change-the-background-color-of-the-body">stackoverflow</a>
        and found that I have to import the the css file by giving
        the file a name. Then for it to appear, I have to add it
        in a line of code, within a div, with curly brackets.
        <br>

        <h3>Home page construction:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>
      There is the addition of the Carosuel code as mentioned in week 4. 
    </li> 
    <li>
        Beginning of how to code the Satistics into the page. Would be using
        <a href="https://canvasjs.com/react-charts/chart-index-data-label/">Canvas.js</a>
        I had trouble figuring how to implement this. Would add if there
        is time left.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mission statement:
        used h2 and p tag in js file along with giving it a 
        class of its own to manipulate font size and font family.
    </li>
    <li>
        Adding Registration Form:
        <br>
        Was able to make the form into a popup window with a close button
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8fAO_zyFAM&t=784s">Reference Code</a>
    </li>
    </ol> 
    <h3>Endangered Animals page</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            As shown in protoype, I would implement a searchbar using the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7niho285qs&t=689s">Searchbar Code</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Part of creating the Searchbar I wanted to add icons,
            mui icons. This process took forever bc I was downloading the
            wrong package
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="media/install_mui.jpg" style="width: 800px;">
            <br>
            <br>
            This is the correct package need
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="media/correct_install_mui.jpg" style="width: 800px;">
            <br>
            <br>
            The search bar would use data I found online from <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?direction=desc&page=2&sort=extinction_status">WWF Species List</a>
            The data is not a json file so I will need to convert it to an excel sheet:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="media/sheets.jpg" style="width: 800px;">
            <br>
            <br>
            Convert to json file by using<a href="https://beautifytools.com/excel-to-json-converter.php">Beautify Tools</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="media/json.jpg" style="width:800px;">           
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Charities</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Started by making an excel sheet that would have about 
            10 charities. In this sheet, there will be columns for 
            charity_name, phone, address, and their website link. Finally
            it will be converted to a json file.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="media/charties_json.jpg">
        </li>
        <li>
            A problem that I faced was how the information from json file was not showing on 
            the card. Card is placed using React-Bootstrap.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src = 'media/charties_json.jpg'>
        </li>
        <li>
            I also followed a 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhWFs0diAPE&t=325s"> 
                YouTube tutorial</a>
            demonstrating how to render info dynamic.
            <br>
            Upon using this tutorial, I noticed that I would need to 
            input my json file internally into my js file. This wasn't 
            a problem, for I just needed to copy and paste what I had.   
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Indigenous People Page </h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>
            For this page I would like to input information
            of 2 tribes.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
    <p>
        I would say that my project is very neat and organized.
        This is my first react app that I worked on by myself.
        Learning how to code in react was difficult for me but I 
        managed to put a finish project together.
