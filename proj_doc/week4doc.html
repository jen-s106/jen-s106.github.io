             <p>Since I will be using React, I will need to download all
             the files that are needed:
             <br>
             <img src="media/begin_react.jpg" alt="begin react" width="200px" height="100px">
             <img src="media/rect_success.jpg" alt="react">
             <br>
              The coding that I would need to get done 
                would be in App.js, to show on localhost, and App.css
                for styling.
                <br> 
                Because I am new to React, I would search YouTube videos
                to help me understand better. This will help me avoid the headache
                I will get from trying to learn as I code.

                To begin this project, I implemented a carousel from bootstrap.
                I was able to find JavaScript code to put in the new document carousel.js
                and used carousel in App.js for it to show on localhost.
                <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/carousel/"> Carousel code</a>
                To use bootstrap I needed to install pakages along with 
                its css.
