      <h1>Week 1 Assignment</h1>
      <p>In “As We May Think by Vannevar” Bush, the author points out that scientific research has been used to aid with war and he begins to question what scientists are going to do after they are not needed to aid in the war. An example would be how the war has had an impact on physicists to leave their independent research and create destructive gadgets. These scientists had a purpose for the research that they are doing but now they aren’t left with one. Besides his concerns, he has a very uplifting tone when predicting how the world would develop with the start of the world wide web and the internet. He acknowledges these inventions have power that is beyond human ability. He also acknowledges how science can help individuals with their everyday activities and improve their mental health. Bush ends on a positive note that scientific research is needed to create these innovations. On the other hand, in “Long Live the Web” by Tim Berners Lee, the author seems to be having a different tone towards our innovation of the World Wide Web, for it is something that can be regulated and monitored by the government and how some sites can take down a website if the information is threatening to society. These regulations would break the concept of the World Wide Web being available to all users to access. What threatens WWW should be solved to promote future advancements of this innovation.
