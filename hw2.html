    <h1>Homework 2</h1>
    <p>Net art is a term that derived in the 1990s which involved art being created online. Because net.art was starting
      out, not everyone undersood the purpose of learning how to use the internet. It was seen as a hobby
      to learn about computers since, most businesses couldn't afford to have a website or didn't
      need an employee to have these skills. However, as time passed, we are now in a digital era where
      knowing about digital art is essential for companies to grow.
